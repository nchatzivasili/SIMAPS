Please find below indicative questions to base your feedback:

1. Do you agree with the items (questions) of the SIMAPS questionnaire (in terms of semantic behavioural interoperability)? (Yes/No | Rationale)

2. Do you have any changes to propose (e.g. additional options, terminology issues)? (Yes/No | Rationale)

3. Do you think that there is any item (question) missing? (Yes/No | Rationale)

4. IMAPS team suggests to add an item related to the EIRA v4.1.0 ABB ‘Data Mapping’. Do you have any suggestions? (Yes/No | Rationale)

 Note: The EIRA ABB ‘Data mapping' is an equivalence relationship between two data items with ontological value.

5. IMAPS team suggests to add an item related to the EIRA v4.1.0 ABB ‘Core Data Model’. Do you have any suggestions? (Yes/No | Rationale)

 Note: The EIRA ABB ‘Core data model' is a context-neutral data model that captures the fundamental characteristics of an entity or a core set of entities

6. IMAPS team suggests to add an item related to once-only principle. Currently, this aspect is only examined in IMAPS questionnaire (prefilling of information and data).

 Example: ‘Can existing information of users be reused with their explicit consent or is data requested from registers or other administrations, so that users have to resubmit  those (e.g. data from registries, evidence, etc.)?’. 
Do you agree with our proposition? Do you have any suggestions? (Yes/No | Rationale)

7. IMAPS team suggests to add an item related to open standards. Currently, in SIMAPS questionnare there are items assessing the use and the consumption of open data and semantic standards e.g. items D2, C2, and C8. 

 Example: ‘Do you plan to use open standards for all data formats that are exchanged between communication interfaces?’
 Do you agree with our proposition? Do you have any suggestions? (Yes/No | Rationale)

8. IMAPS team suggests to add  the following question to assess further the semantic interoperability aspects of a digital public service: ‘Can application data be transferred   from one to the other system and be semantically correctly processed by the target system?’

  Do you agree with our proposition? Do you have any suggestions? (Yes/No | Rationale)
